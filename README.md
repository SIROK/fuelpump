## Getting Started

### Build

To get started modifying the components or the docs, first install the necessary dependencies, from the root of the project:

```bash
$ npm install
```

To build a production version of the components, run:

```
$ npm run build
```

This will clean the `dist` folder and rebuild the assets.

## Documentation

At this stage, docs is located in [Wiki](https://github.com/sotayamashita/bdash/wiki). I am taking note to go through the process of this and understand reasons for selecting technique.

If you have any question or suggestion, please feel free to create issues or pull request. When you create issues or pull request, please read [Contributin](#contributing) before.
